# About
These are my university notes - I am studying for an MMATH at the University of Edinburgh, these are the LaTeX'd version of my course notes, updated as I study.

## Disclaimer
These notes do not contain my origional thoughts, attempts will be made to reference all courses appropriately but I will often fail to do this through a mixture of laziness and workload. This does not mean that the thoughts came from me. If there are any mistakes that you notice please email me at: william.bevington@zoho.eu

## Note to self:

 * git commit -m "message"
 * git push -u origin master
