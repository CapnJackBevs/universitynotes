# What is all of this?
Welcome, friends, to the mother of all analysis folders! 

# The "./Reccomended" directory
This holds all of the reccomended reading materials for the University of Edinburgh's "Honors Analysis" course. This will hopefully develoup into a folder of my own creating with all my various code and notes in! This also contains the reading list from the course!
## Bookmarks:
 * Tao II: Section 2.2

# The "./Other" directory
These are materials that I've found on my own (yay me), and will eventually have little reviews and comments along with them. Maybe I'll even make my own set of notes - don't set your hopes too high though!

# The "./Tools" directory
Currently empty.
This will contain all of the scripts and programs that I've written for analysis stuff. They might be good, they might be awful, one thing's for sure - they're probably written in Haskell!
