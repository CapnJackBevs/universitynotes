<h2>Intermediate Value Theorem</h2>

The Intermediate Value Theorem (or "IVT") is probably one of the most important theorems in any first course in real analysis. Essentially the theorem tells us that the image of a continuous funtion \(f\) will hit every value in some interval, allowing us the intuition of a continuous function being one which you could draw "without taking your pen off the paper". 

Formally the theorem is as follows:
<div class="thm">
<b>Theorem:</b> Let \(I\subseteq\mathbb{R}\) be a closed interval and \(f:I\to\mathbb{R}\) be continuous, then if \(u\) is a number between \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) then \(\exists c\in I: f(c) = u\).
</div>

As an example, say we want to know that there is a number \(x\) satisfying \(x^2=2\). As a naive attempt to see this we could use a proof by contradiction, but the intermediate value theorem tells us immediately that this is true; the function \(f(x)=\sqrt{x}\) is continuous on the closed interval \([0,4]\) and so any element \(u\in f([0,4])=[0,2]\) exists, and as \(0\leq\sqrt{2}\leq2\) we can conclude that there such a number exists. In fact this method is a lot more powerful than the naive attempt because it tells us that <i>\ny</i> polynomial which crosses the \(x\)-axis must have a root which is a real number.

<h2>On to topology</h2>
<!-- Prove the IVT and discuss that the proof considers the "open-set" definition of continuity, which is a topological analogue of the epsilon-delta definition -->
