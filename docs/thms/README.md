## On classification; 
basis vectors determine every vector under a linear map.

##Manifolds and machine learning;
It seems that generative machine learning uses pull-backs from a high-dimensional output space to a low-dimensional input space as to be able to find vectors predominantly responsible for certain changes, for example, in the Distill article they find a 'bolding vector' which summarises how to best bold a font.
