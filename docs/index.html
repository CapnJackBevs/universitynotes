<h1>About</h1>
These are my university notes - I am studying for an MMATH at the University of Edinburgh, these are the LaTeX'd version of my course notes, updated as I study. There is a github repository of all of these notes, but this webstie will include any interactive widgets, which I am hoping to generate as my studies progress.

<h5>Disclaimer</h5>
These notes do not contain my origional thoughts, attempts will be made to reference all courses appropriately but I will often fail to do this through a mixture of laziness and workload. This does not mean that the thoughts came from me. If there are any mistakes that you notice please email me at: william.bevington@zoho.eu
